# TreapsADT
ADT for Treaps
This project is an implementation of the Treap abstract data type. The purpose of a Treap ADT is to to keep a binary search tree that also has random priority number.
The key functions of the Treap ADT are:
Insert: Inserts a new node into the tree as long as the key is not already in the Treap while maintaining BST and random priority status.
Get: Returns True if a given key is in the Treap and returns False otherwise
Delete: Removes the node with a given key from the Treap while mantating BST and random priority status.
